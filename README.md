# CSC_414-G4-CryptoPals_Suite
## Prototype implementation of introductory cryptography utilities

The associated repository contains project files for a software suite designed to solve the first set of 8 tasks provided by the CryptoPals organization in their publicly available Crypto Challenges.
All tasks were solved with solutions programmed from scratch in the C++ programming language developed as a Microsoft Console Application.
Accompanying the task solutions is a primary .cpp file that, when run, offers to execute the tests explicitly provided by the CryptoPals organization to prove that the challenges have been met.
Additionally, these tests and many more lesser test cases regardng the overall project code are contained within a GoogleTest (gTest) framework based solution.

All work originally provided in this repository has been created as a mock team project for a university level course.
